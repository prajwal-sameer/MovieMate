📘 Project Overview – MovieMate

MovieMate is a movie recommendation system developed using the C programming language.
The project is designed to show how structured data and logic in C can be used
to build a graphical user interface (GUI) application.

🎯 Objective of the Project

The main objectives of MovieMate are:

- To understand the use of **structures in C**
- To implement *menu-driven programming*
- To learn how to build a *Windows GUI using Win32 API*
- To manage and display large datasets in C
- To show GUI-based applications

🧠 Concept Used

The project is based on the following core concepts:

- Structures (`struct`)** to store movie details
- Arrays of structures** for different genres
- Conditional logic** for genre selection
- Functions** to organize program flow
- Event-driven programming** (in GUI version)

🎬 Movie Data Organization

Movies are categorized into different genres:

- Romance
- Adventure
- Comedy
- Action
- Animated
- Short Films

Each movie contains the following details:

- Movie Name
- Director
- Runtime
- IMDb Rating
- Rotten Tomatoes Rating
- Cast
- Awards
- Description
- Trailer Link
- Watch Movie Link
- Movie Poster Image (GUI version)

🖥 Console Version

The console version of MovieMate allows users to:

1. Select a genre using numbers
2. View a list of movies in that genre
3. Select a movie
4. View complete movie details in text format

This version focuses on logic and data handling.

🪟 GUI Version (Win32)

The GUI version provides:

- Button-based navigation
- ListBox for movie selection
- controls for movie details
- Image display for movie posters
- Buttons for watching trailer and movie
- Back and Home button

This version focuses on user experience and interface design.

🔁 Program Flow (Simplified)

1. Application starts
2. User selects genre
3. Movie list is displayed
4. User selects a movie
5. Movie details are shown
6. User can watch trailer or movie
7. User can go back or return to home

📌 Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, the following skills are gained:

- Strong understanding of C structures
- Practical experience with Win32 API
- Better understanding of event handling
- Ability to design modular programs
- Confidence in building real-world projects in C

📚 Conclusion

MovieMate successfully show how a single dataset and logic
can be reused across multiple application types.
The project strengthens core programming skills and introduces
GUI development using the Windows API.
